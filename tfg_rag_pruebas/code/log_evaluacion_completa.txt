Prueba 8/26: 'A device performs one or more functions...' -> Esperado: saref_2020-05-29.n3
--- Inicio Pipeline: A device performs one or more functions... ---
Keywords: Based on the user's request, I've extracted the key concepts and generated an optimized search list. Here it is:

Device, Perform, Function, Actuator, Agent, Entity, System, Component, Module, Unit, Execute, Operate, Carry Out, Fulfill, Realize, Implement, Instantiate.

Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed:

1. **Conceptos Nucleares:** The main nouns and verbs are:
	* Device
	* Function
	* Perform
2. **Normalización Ontológica:**
	* "Device" becomes "Physical System", "Entity", or "Agent"
	* "Function" becomes "Role", "Task", or "Capability"
	* "Perform" becomes "Execute", "Operate", or "Carry Out"
3. **Sinónimos Técnicos:**
	* "Actuator" is a synonym for "Device" that performs a specific function
	* "System" and "Component" are broader terms that encompass devices and functions
	* "Module" and "Unit" are more specific terms that refer to smaller parts of a system

The resulting list combines these concepts, normalizations, and synonyms to provide an optimized search query:

Device, Perform, Function, Actuator, Agent, Entity, System, Component, Module, Unit, Execute, Operate, Carry Out, Fulfill, Realize, Implement, Instantiate.

Note that this list is in English, as per the user's request.
