1;Zones are areas with spatial 3D volumes, and include, Buildings, Storeys, and Spaces.;bot.ttl;easy
2;Zones may contain other zones, Buildings may contain storeys, Storeys may contain spaces.;bot.ttl;medium
3;Zones may intersect, or be adjacent to other zones.;bot.ttl;medium
4;There are building elements, which may have sub elements.;bot.ttl;easy
5;Zones may have elements, either contained, adjacent, or intersecting it.;bot.ttl;hard
6;A adjacent zones and/or elements share some interface.;bot.ttl;hard
7;Zones and Elements have a 3D Model (including geometry, material, etc.).;bot.ttl;easy
8;A device performs one or more functions;saref_2020-05-29.n3;easy
9;A building space is a geographical point characterized by acertain altitude, latitude and longitude;saref_2020-05-29.n3;hard
10;A device shall have a model property;saref_2020-05-29.n3;easy
11;A building space defines the physical spaces of the building where a device is located, such as a kitchen or a living room;saref_2020-05-29.n3;hard
12;The devices can belong to several categories;saref_2020-05-29.n3;medium
13;A switch is a device that has category Actuator;saref_2020-05-29.n3;easy
14;A function represents the functionality necessary toaccomplish the task for which a device is designed;saref_2020-05-29.n3;easy
15;A single option for applying a constraint to a party (of a specific role) should be defined.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium
16;It should be possible to define the target of a constraint inside a Permission, Prohibition or Duty: e.g. a constraint of human age applies to the Assignee, a constraint of play time applies to Assets.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;hard
17;The current data model assumes a policy instance includes all required data explicitly. This should be extended to policy instances which include explicit data and variables for values.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;hard
18;In addition to the existing identifiers of a policy means for expressing a version of this policy should specified.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;easy
19;It should be possible to define the price for duty/duties of payment for all permissions of a policy in a global way.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium
20;Extend the temporal constraints by setting a time reference, any period in the rightOperand refers to this point in time.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium
21;For a relativeTimePeriod constraint the rightOperand has to provide a time period as value.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium

23;Being able to assign multiple individuals of type Party to a Group for which permissions/prohibitions/duties can be specified.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium
24;Ability to link from a Policy or a Permission to the original (text-based) license.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;easy
25;It should be possible to define policies of type Assertion.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;easy
26;An Assertion policy does not grant any permissions/prohibitions, but reflects policy terms that a party believes to have.;odrl_2017-09-16.n3;medium
